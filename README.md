# Understanding_Customer_Trends_with_Big_Data_Analytics

This project analyzes e-commerce behavior data from a multi-category store to provide actionable insights for businesses, helping them:

**Optimize sales and revenue:** Identify peak sales periods, understand customer behavior, and personalize the shopping experience.

**Build a recommendation engine:** Recommend products to users based on their past purchases and browsing history.

**Analyze supply chain operations:** Gain insights into customer demand to optimize inventory management and fulfillment.

**Determine optimal pricing strategies:** Use data-driven analysis to set competitive prices and maximize profits.

**Detect suspicious activity:** Identify potentially fraudulent purchases and protect your business from financial losses.

# Data Description

The project utilizes the publicly available "E-Commerce Behavior Data from Multi-Category Store" dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store](url)

This dataset includes information on customer activity (browsing history, add-to-cart behavior, purchase history) and product information (category, brand, price).

# Analysis Techniques

The project employs various data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from the e-commerce behavior data, including:

• Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.

• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data trends and patterns.

• Statistical analysis to identify correlations between variables.

• Machine learning techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, and collaborative filtering for tasks like price optimization and recommendation engine development.

• Develop interactive dashboards for data visualization and real-time performance monitoring.

# Future Work

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and development. Here are some potential areas for future work:

• Evaluate the impact of recommendation systems on user engagement and customer lifetime value.

• Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the recommendation engine performance.

• Explore A/B testing to compare different recommendation algorithms and personalize them based on user demographics.

• Integrate additional data sources such as customer reviews and social media data for more comprehensive analysis.

• Utilize advanced machine learning techniques for customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and churn prediction.
